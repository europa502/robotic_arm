# robotic_arm

Robotic arm can perform diffrent task which can be programmed by entering input via the prototype arm. 
You can also use the robotic arm to do the mirroring of the prototype arm and also set the robotic arm to perform any actions in 
loops. 

To teach the robtic arm to do certain task you have to move the prototype arm to desired position and then press the push button once.
Repeat it until you have achieved your desired motion. Now press the push button twice to start the process. If you want to interrupt the
process simply press the reset button on your arduino board.

Since we made it within a day, we made its body using ice-cream sticks. A blender design is also provided in the repo in case you 
want to 3d print the model. 

As always, feel free to modify acording to your need and use it.

Hope you would like it.:)
